The “Osen Clock” watch has all the features that users expect in a digital watch, and some unusual features.

The watch has the following features:

Time and date displayed on the screen. Current time is in large numbers, date is in small numbers above it.

Light: Pressing the light button on the side of the watch activates a light while the button is pressed. Pressing and holding that button for 3 seconds turns on the light and keeps it on, until the button is held again for 3 seconds or up to 2 hours. After 2 hours, it will automatically turn off.

Alarm. A daily alarm may be set for a given time. The alarm may be enabled or disabled. When the alarm is enabled and the alarm time is reached, the watch will beep fast for 5 seconds, then slowly for 30 seconds, then fast for another 5 seconds. Pressing any button stops the alarm sound (in addition to performing its normal function).

Timer. Timer mode shows a count-up timer that starts at 00:00. When the timer is started, it counts up. Pressing the start/stop button will pause the timer, pressing it again continues counting up. Pressing and holding the button for 3 seconds resets the timer to 00:00 and stops counting.
