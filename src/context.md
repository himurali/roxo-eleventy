### Economics?

‘Cycling for short distances can result in an annual benefit of Rs 1.8 trillion to the Indian economy, which is equivalent to 1.6% of India’s annual GDP



### Reduce Imports and Increase Exports

The total imports of bicycles was more than 7 lakh in 2018–19 and the same is increasing on a year-to-year basis. Of which, more than 50% imports were from China. This apart, India has the potential to export in a big way—beyond USD 360 million exports in 2018–19 .

### World Leader in Bicycle Manufacturing

Explore how Indian Bicycle Industry csn become a world leader in design, engineering and manufacturing and to meet the future demand arising out of the bicycle’s inherent, incredible and indefinite benefits and sustainable character.



### Challenges?

India was one of the leaders in Bicycle Manufacturing , but in the last two decades India has LOST the opportunity to be a world leader in exporting bicycles. China and Taiwan have captured the opportunity and have developed complete ecosystems for making the best cycles. BCDC creates multiple windows to explore initiatives to win in the global market. Post Corona with the push for "Make In India" and the reduction on the dependency of chinese imports world over - there is a great opportunity for India to promote cycles and sustainability.



#### Import from China

India Imports around 7-8 lakhs cycles and cycle parts from china. Taiwan a small nation is the leading exporter of cycles to USA. India lost the competetiveness in the 1990’s to china and taiwan - due to strategic policy mistakes and lack of innovation in delivering quality cycles.


#### Lack of Penentration in Indian Middle Class Segment

Indian cycles not penetrated the middle class market for wellness and attractiveness..The Indian bicycle industry is the second largest in the world, next only to China, with an annual production of 22 million and a turnover of Rs 7000 crore; through 4000 MSMEs that employ nearly one million people in the entire value chain. However, the industry suffers on account of technology gap, lack of usage of superior materials and demand-related bottlenecks. The dependence of the industry on institutional sales is substantial.  Indian Middle class has drifted away from the bicycle to the two wheeler and cars. This shift need to be reversed by enabling cycles that meet the multiple needs of the middle class.  

#### Lack of Bicycle Design Culture

Indian cycle manufacturing is lagging in research and design to take on the global competition. We just don’t need a designer with a bicycle design. What we need is a design culture for bicycle designing.  This is the first step in this direction , done for the first time in India. Great design starts with the customer.

#### Design Stagnancy

Due to the large dependency of the Indian cycle industry on the Institutional Sales, there has been a stagnancy in the make of the cycles as the industry does not see demand in the market for the low cost cycles. With margins very less for these cycles - the design and the make has remained same for the last few decades.
